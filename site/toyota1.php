            <h2 id="lime_text">Why TOYOTA?</h2>
            <p style="color:#8E8E8E">&emsp;Toyota took advantage of a rapidly growing Japanese economy to sell cars to
                a growing middle-class,
                leading to the development of the Toyota Corolla, which would go on to become the world’s all-time
                best-selling automobile. The booming economy also funded an international expansion that would allow
                Toyota to grow into one of the largest automakers in the world, the largest company in Japan and the
                ninth-largest company in the world by revenue, as of December 2020. Toyota was the world's first automobile
                manufacturer to produce more than 10 million vehicles per year, a record set in 2012, when it also reported
                the production of its 200 millionth vehicle.
                <br>
                &emsp;The final version of the GT-Four included improvements such as an all-aluminum hood to save weight, four-channel ABS (with G-force sensor), an improved turbocharger (incorrectly known by enthusiasts as the CT20B), and Super Strut Suspension. The 2500 homologation cars built to allow Toyota to enter the GT-Four as a Group A car in the World Rally Championship also sported extras such as all of the plumbing required to activate an anti-lag system, a water spray bar for the Intercooler's front heat exchanger, a water injection system for detonation protection, a hood spoiler mounted in front of the windscreen to stop hood flex at high speed and the standard rear spoiler mounted on riser blocks.

             <p id="blackgray_text">
                &emsp; In many ways, the Toyota 1JZ-GTE engine drew the short end of the stick.
                Even a professional athlete won’t shine as bright if they have an Olympic
                gold medalist for a brother. That is similar to the situation that the
                1JZ-GTE finds itself in. With the newer, more advanced, and more refined
                2JZ-GTE stealing the hearts of virtually everyone, the 1JZ-GTE is often
                forgotten.
                    
                &emsp;While the 1JZ-GTE might not be as popular of an option, its relative 
                obscurity has its benefits. Sharing most of its technical attributes with the 
                2JZ, the 1JZ-GTE is essentially the same engine on a budget. Due to high demand,
                2JZ-GTEs sell for the price of a used BMW these days, 1JZs are much cheaper.
                1JZ-GTEs can often rival 2JZ-GTEs in motorsport applications as well. In fact,
                the 1JZ-GTE is slightly superior to the 2JZ in drift applications due to its 
                short-block, high RPM power delivery.
