            <p style="color:#8E8E8E">&emsp;Lexus (レクサス, Rekusasu) is the luxury vehicle division 
                of the Japanese automaker Toyota. The Lexus brand is marketed in more than 90 countries 
                and territories worldwide and is Japan's largest-selling make of premium cars. It has 
                ranked among the 10 largest Japanese global brands in market value. Lexus is headquartered 
                in Nagoya, Japan.<br>&emsp;The F1 project was completed in 1989, involving 60 designers, 24 
                engineering teams, 1,400 engineers, 2,300 technicians, 220 support workers, approximately 450 
                prototypes and more than $1 billion in costs. The resulting car, the Lexus LS 400, had a 
                design that shared no major elements with previous Toyota vehicles, with a new 4.0 L V8 gasoline 
                engine and rear-wheel drive. The car debuted in January 1989 at the North American 
                International Auto Show in Detroit and official sales of the vehicle began the following 
                September at a network of 81 new Lexus dealerships in the U.S. The LS 400 was sold along 
                with the smaller ES 250, a rebadged version of the Japanese market Toyota Camry Prominent/Toyota 
                Vista. The launch of Lexus was accompanied by a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign.[</p>

             <p id="blackgray_text">&emsp;The early Lexus IS300 sedan combined better-than-BMW reliability
                  with the 2JZ engine from the Mk4 Toyota Supra. But it wasn’t the only contemporary Lexus
                   with that engine. So, if you want an upscale Mk4 Toyota Supra, you may want to take a 
                   look at the Lexus SC300. <br>&emsp;It didn't take long for the aftermarket to realize that 
                   this engine could be tuned to make way more than 320 horsepower with seemingly no detriment to 
                   reliability. <br>&emsp;For starters, all versions of the 2JZ used a cast iron block. 
                   That's not great where weight is concerned, but for ultimate strength, it's ideal. Papadakis 
                   also points out that the 2JZ is a closed-deck engine, which means the cylinders themselves are 
                   quite strong. This is why the 2JZ-GTE can handle a ton of turbo boost pressure. You can force a 
                   lot of air through those cylinders without having to worry about the basic structure of the engine.</p>
