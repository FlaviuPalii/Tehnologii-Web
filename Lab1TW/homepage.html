            <p style="color:#8E8E8E">&emsp;There’s no doubt that car enthusiasts consider
                the 1990s to be the golden era for Japanese Domestic Market (JDM) cars.
                Electric cars were still a distant vision at the tail end of the last decade
                and the performance vehicles rolling off the production line in Japan’s powerhouse
                motor industry were still entirely mechanical.<br>&emsp;These are cars or versions of cars that
                have been produced solely for their local, Japanese market and have not been exported
                to most (or any) other markets. The 1990s, in particular, gave birth to most of the iconic
                JDM cars, we lust after today. Without further due, these are the best JDM cars that came in
                that period.</p>

             <p id="blackgray_text">&emsp;In its original form, the engine had a 10.0:1 compression ratio that enabled an output of 256 hp and 
                 260 lb-ft (353 Nm) of torque. It was revised for the 1995 model year, receiving a host of upgrades 
                 which included lighter rods and pistons, sequential fuel injection, new cams with a slightly more 
                 aggressive profile, or an improved exhaust manifold. The compression ratio increased to 10.4:1, 
                 resulting in an increase of power to 261 hp and 269 lb-ft (365 Nm) of torque. A second revision came 
                 in 1997 when among the new goodies Toyota added its trademark VVT-i (variable valve timing) technology. In this final form, the V8 
                 could make up to 300 hp and 310 lb-ft (420 Nm) of torque.</p>
