<p><h3 style="color:rgb(218, 218, 218)">There’s no doubt that car enthusiasts consider the 1990s to be the golden era for Japanese Domestic Market (JDM) cars.
Electric cars were still a distant vision at the tail end of the last decade and the performance vehicles rolling off the production line in Japan’s powerhouse motor industry were still entirely mechanical.
</h3><br>
<p><h3 style="color:rgb(214, 214, 214)">These are cars or versions of cars that have been produced solely for their local, Japanese market and have not been exported to most (or any) other markets. The 1990s, in particular, gave birth to most of the iconic JDM cars, we lust after today. Without further due, these are the best JDM cars that came in that period.</h3></p>
